To get a better experience during development we suggest to install the STS editor.
Installing the required dependencies and building the sources for the application needs to be done in two steps:

1. Install [STS](https://spring.io/tools/sts/all) editor (for example spring-tool-suite-3.9.0.RELEASE-e4.7.0-macosx-cocoa-x86_64.tar)

2. Install Gradle IDE pack 3.8x + 1.0x from STS market place

3. Import the project

4. Add tomcat 9 server

 Download Tomcat 9(https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi) for example: apache-tomcat-9.0.0.M22 

5 .Build and run using gui


## Test

From the STS editor run `JUnit test`
